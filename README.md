# NEP4-Training

## Research Focus
The project, led by **Professor Keivan Esfarjani**, with **Huy Nguyen** and **James Xu** as undergraduate students, focuses on training and minimizing the force loss of the potential for different alloys, such as **J14**, and other molecules like **water (H₂O)** and **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**. The training utilizes **NEP4 (Neuroevolution Potential)** and leverages the **UVA Afton High-Performance Computing system**. These models will be used to perform **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations** to analyze **thermal conductivity**. See [MD Runs Repo](https://github.com/huy310304/GPUMD-UVA)

## Tools and Methods
- **NEP4** for efficient potential training.
- **Python** and **gnuplot** for data analysis and visualization, automating loss calculations and comparison graphs.
- **Linux commands** and **SLURM** for managing simulation jobs on the UVA Afton supercomputer.
